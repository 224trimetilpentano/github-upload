# rec

I always forget what I do and how much time I spend for it, Rec helps me in this matter.

Rec is a software that keeps track of daily records.
Each record has an initial time, a duration, a description and tags; records are grouped in days.

The main tabs are the Week Report tab, with some useful info about your last 7 days, and the Search tab,
whose search engine lets you analize records by tag, description and date.

For now the recording is done manually, maybe in the future I'll implement an Andorid app.

Still buggy, needs a documentation.
